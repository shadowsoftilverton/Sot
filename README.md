The Shadows of Tilverton script code and module.

Much of this code is copyright Bioware. Some of it has been contributed to the SoT module by:

Ashton "Foxtrot" S.

Stephen "Invictus" Y.

Daniel "Avesenchai" P.

Ian "Hardcore UFO" D.

"JJPSX"

This code originally powered the roleplay server Shadows of Tilverton.

It's now actively in-use on the social server The Shattered Realms.

Two upcoming roleplay servers may make use of it; expect more information on the Bioware boards.

While we'd appreciate it if appropriate credit was given, we understand that the NWN community doesn't always operate on transparency. Deceit is fine, too.

Hopefully you all find it useful. Cheers!
